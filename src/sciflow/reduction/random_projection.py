    This implementation was originally developed in a separate research repository and was reused here as part of the current project.

    Original repository:
    https://github.com/ZanderNic/FrechetRadar/blob/master/src/RadarDataGen/Metrics/random_projections.py

    The module implements a random projection layer inspired by compressed sensing and random projection theory, mainly based on the work:
    "Near-Optimal Signal Recovery From Random Projections: Universal Encoding Strategies?" by Emmanuel J. Candès and Terence Tao.
